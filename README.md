# GPXviz

## This project is in sunset mode

I've gone as far as I can with the original base but the weight of earlier decisions is now
stressing me. I'm starting up a new project for GPXmagic v2.0.

## Background

Someone on the RGT Group asked if there was a quick and simple way to check out a GPX file before committing to a Magic Road.

"Sounds like an interesting little project", I thought.

Here is the result.

The aim is to be focussed and simple to use. It's not a fancy GPX editor. Just the essentials:

1. Quick overview of the track
2. "Fly through" the track to look for oddities.
3. Inspect possible errors from various angles to see what is wrong.

It all runs in your browser. No security issues, no sign-ups, no licence, no support.

It's written in Elm and uses awesome libraries; thanks to all those who work on these projects.
