'About' tab scroll bar stops working.

Steps to repro:
- From Edge on Win 10, go to http://stepwiserefinement.co.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/GPXmagic/index.html
- The webpage defaults to the 'About' tab. 
- Open a GPX file by clicking on, 'Load GPX from your computer' and selecting a valid GPX file from the Windows Explorer window.
- The filename now appears at the top-right of the webpage indicating it is for cycling.
- Use the scroll bars to view the text at the bottom of the window.  The scroll bar works.
- Click on the 'Map' tab.  A map of the route is rendered.
- Click on the 'About' tab.

Result:  The scroll bar no longer works.

Work-around:  [I haven't found one.  Refreshing the webpage will abandon the existing GPX file without prompting to save.]

Why access the 'About' tab?  I'm new to the program and find that I reference the descriptions for each of the functions until I have them memorized.
