'Fly-through' for 'Third person' does not function.

Steps to repro:
- From Edge on Win 10, go to http://stepwiserefinement.co.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/GPXmagic/index.html
- The webpage defaults to the 'About' tab.
- Open a GPX file by clicking on, 'Load GPX from your computer' and selecting a valid GPX file from the Windows Explorer window.
- The filename now appears at the top-right of the webpage indicating it is for cycling.  The 'Nothing to undo' window appears on the right.
- In the right window, click 'Fly-through'.  In the left window, click 'Third person'.  In the right window, click the 'Go' button.

Result:  The 'Third person' view does not change even though the 'Segment' and 'Metres from start' values are incrementing.
