module ToDo exposing (..)

--TODO: USABILITY - Save As ... (make filename an input field !!)

--TODO: When segment header loads, say if it's not in the bounding box.
-- and provide optiom to unsert between markers. (scale and rotate!)

--TODO: Autofix to work on selection also. (?)

--TODO: Better zoom reset on new model load.

--TODO: Sponsorship link.

--TODO: Put Autofix and Simplify on new Tab?

--TODO: Debt. More modularisation. Chop up the types and model. Main is toooo big.
-- Loads of functions can move -- just need to explicitly list the fields they need
-- in the type signature, instead of using Model!

--TODO: Debt. Reduce duplication.

--TODO: Imperial measurements in views.

--TODO: Is there anything I can do to make it faster for big routes?

--TODO: Popup tool help on all accordion tabs?

--TODO: "Split track" to show warning (+ Feather icon) if segments less than the maximum segment?

--TODO: Komoot for similar integration (for me). Then RideWithGPS maybe.
--NB Komoot uses the client_id:client_secret format.
--Waiting for a response from Komoot. Need client_id.

--TODO: Say if filename is too long for Magic Roads. (50 chars.)

--CAN'T: USABILITY - Prompt for file Save when navigating away. Should be poss now it's an Application.
-- This seems to be impossible.
