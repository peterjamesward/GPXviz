module ToDo exposing (..)

--TODO: Deployment script !!!!!

--TODO: Let user choose whether bend smoother should smooth gradient to markers or bend only. (??)

--TODO: Komoot. Thinking of adding a new view Tab visible on load (and after) for
-- route loading. This would give plenty of space for local, Strava and Komoot loads.
-- Maybe also for some rarely needed, load-related tools ("Simplify").

--TODO: Guidance text on tabs.

--TODO: Debt. More modularisation. Chop up the types and model. Main is toooo big.
-- Loads of functions can move -- just need to explicitly list the fields they need
-- in the type signature, instead of using Model!

--TODO: Debt. Reduce duplication.

--TODO: Adjustable/selectable filter parameters.

--TODO: Put Autofix and Simplify on new Tab? -- Filter tab now it's there??

--TODO: Imperial measurements in views.

--TODO: "Split track" to show warning (+ Feather icon) if segments less than the maximum segment?

--TODO: Still worth checking if we can trap any navigate-away actions.
