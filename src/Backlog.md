1. Elevate all points by set amount to correct Strava or route planner inaccuracy
   
2. Set max slope either over defined range of points or over whole route

3. Set minimum slope as -25% as that is what RGT will do anyway

4. Next one is part of the smoothing I do in GPX smoother. May not be for everyone, but I normally set a slope difference between all trackpoints at somewhere between 0.3 and 1% to guarantee a smooth ride. It almost inevitably alters the profile though and I then use the original elevation profile to make adjustments, so this would only be useful to me if you could have a reference point to then try to adjust the slope back to the right shape, but smoother. So either something from veloviewer or the original profile in the background

5. One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.
